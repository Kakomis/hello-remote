Since I don't know how you find 
love in L.A. they don't make'em
like they do in the country,
The city moves too fast to appreciate
all the time it takes for sweet loving.

 Listen for fate's whisper,
it'll try and warn you,
telling your heart to be cautious 
of a lover trying to harm you

All the girls in LA look like they're fadin' away,
a woman should be strong with thick legs and big arms,
the stars in the sky, they put em on the street
with the bums and the tramps, that nobody needs

Listen for fate's whisper,
it'll try and warn you,
telling your heart to be cautious of a lover trying to harm you
