Since I don't know how you find 
love in L.A. they don't make'em
like they do in the country,
The city moves too fast to appreciate
all the time it takes for sweet loving.

 Listen for fate's whisper,
it'll try and warn you,
telling your heart to be cautious 
of a lover trying to harm you

All the girls in LA look like they're fadin' away,
a woman should be strong with thick legs and big arms,
the stars in the sky, they put em on the street
with the bums and the tramps, that nobody needs

Listen for fate's whisper,
it'll try and warn you,
telling your heart to be cautious of a lover trying to harm you

you know they say it ain't easy lovin' the same woman forever,
wish you luck on finding the good one on your heart's endeavor,
nothing is easy,
love isn't easy as it seems

You can test a woman for honesty,
you can go ahead and test her for goodness,
but it's a wicked game and a crying shame,
there's no way to give her a love test
